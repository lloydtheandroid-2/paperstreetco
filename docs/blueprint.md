## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Deep teal (#008080), inspired by the film's cool, industrial tones.
- Background color: Very dark desaturated blue (#001F3F) to evoke a gritty, underground feel.
- Accent color: Pale pink (#FFB6C1) to mimic the soap, used sparingly for highlights and interactive elements.
- Font: 'Inter' sans-serif, for a modern, neutral feel in both headings and body text.
- Use a simple icon resembling a bar of pale pink soap for the app logo.
